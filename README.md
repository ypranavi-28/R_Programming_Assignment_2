#Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
#Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it #repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). My assignment is to write a pair of #functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

#Write the following functions:
#makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
#cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already #been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

#Two Functions
#Given a invertible matrix, the following two functions will calculate the inverse matrix or retrieve the inverse matrix from the cache.

#Function “makeCacheMatrix” creates a special “matrix” object that can cache its inverse. makeCacheMatrix contains 4 functions: set, get, #setmean, getmean.
#(1)get is a function that returns the vector x stored in the main function.
#(2)set is a function that changes the vector stored in the main function.
#(3)setmean and getmean are functions very similar to set and get.
#(4)They don’t calculate the mean, they simply store the value of the input in a variable m.
#(5)into the main function makeVector (setmean) and return it (getmean).

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {  
      m <- NULL  
      set <- function(y) {  
            x <<- y  
            m <<- NULL  
      }  
      get <- function() x  
      setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve  
      getinverse <- function() m  
      list(set = set, get = get,  
           setinverse = setinverse,  
           getinverse = getinverse)  
}  

#Function “cacheSolve” computes the inverse of the special “matrix” (which is the input of cachemean) returned by makeCacheMatrix #above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse #from the cache. If the inverse has not been calculated, data gets the matrix stored with makeCacheMatrix, m calculates the inverse, #and x$setmean(m) stores it in the object m in makeCacheMatrix.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {  
      m <- x$getinverse()  
      if(!is.null(m)) {  
            message("getting cached data")  
            return(m)  
      }  
      data <- x$get()  
      m <- solve(data, ...)  
      x$setinverse(m)  
      m  
}
